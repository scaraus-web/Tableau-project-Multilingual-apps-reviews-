Multilingual Mobile App Reviews Dashboard

Tableau + Python Portfolio Project

This project analyzes 1,800+ multilingual mobile app reviews to uncover global patterns in user sentiment, demographic trends, and category performance.

Problem Statement

Mobile app stores generate massive volumes of multilingual reviews that are difficult to interpret at scale.
This survey-style dataset helps answer:

Which app categories receive the highest vs. lowest ratings?

Do demographics (age, gender) affect satisfaction?

How does verification of purchases impact trust in reviews?

What global regions rate apps higher or lower, and why?

Methods

Python (Pandas + Regex): Data cleaning, duplicate removal, normalization.

Tableau Public: Interactive visualizations, geographic maps, demographic impact analysis.

Key Insights

Top categories: Health & Fitness, Games, Entertainment score highest.

Underperformers: Dating and Travel & Local apps consistently struggle.

Verification impact: Verified reviews strongly influence Photography, Education, and Travel apps.

Global variation: Brazil, France, and India rate apps higher; Spain, China, and Australia rate lowest.

Demographics: Females and older demographics report higher satisfaction.

Engagement trend: Review volume crashed 70% in 2025, signaling a potential engagement crisis.
